## An Introduction to the Chapel Language

Some simple programs that use base (`src/serial/`) and
parallel (`src/parallel/`) language features.

The folder `src/parallel/triad` contains code implementing the "triad" computation
`C = A + beta*B` using multiple tasking/shared memory schemes in Chapel, and one in
Fortran with OpenMP.
